<p>It's made using JavaScript, CSS and HTML.</p>

<p>In it's default mode, it paints the grid black on mouseover.</p>

<p>With reset you can clean the grid and go back to the original of 16 x 16</p>

<p>On Create Grid you can create your own custom grid up to a maximum of 100 x 100</p>

<p>With Rainbow Mode, the grid is painted with random rgb colors.</p>
